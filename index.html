			We've all been told since our childhood that smoking was really bad for our health. But do you really understand just how dangerous smoking really is? Tobacco contains nicotine, a highly addictive drug that fuels the high rates of nicotine addiction in the country. Tobacco products also contain many carcinogenic, health-debilitating substances that cause disease and premature death. Among a group of 1000 smokers who are all 30 years of age, a full quarter of them will die of smoking-related illnesses prior to completing middle age, an additional quarter will die prematurely from smoking-related illnesses shortly after retirement age, and another large group will develop debilitating chronic illnesses as a result of their smoking? Most people know how dangerous smoking is, but they don't know just how high the rates of disease and death are for smokers, but when you do the numbers, that is how they come out. For many people, truly understanding and accepting the very real dangers and risks to their health and lives that they're association with smoking becomes the motivating factor that helps them to quit.
